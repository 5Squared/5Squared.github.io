    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Based off the information that's been gathered in these individual test results
        we can get a pretty good understanding of each of our personalities.
    </p>        
    <p> As far as personality types go we have an even split between introverted and extraverted.
        According to the 16 personalities tests we are all different, but in some regards similar.
        Our learning styles are skewed towards visual with some tacticle mixed in as well.
    </p>
    <p> For our group, we will look to usual visual methods to help divide the work up. Using 
        charts or visual aids to show designated work. We will be inclusive of everyones
        learning styles and seek to use periodic catch ups to ensure all are thriving.
