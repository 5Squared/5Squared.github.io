		<p>During the process of compiling assignment 2 for this course, the process was generally quite smooth. 
            All active members participated and completed all tasks assigned to them albeit sometimes at a slightly 
            stretched timeline than requested. There are very little changes to the way in which we are carrying 
            out our communications due to the platform of discord being a very efficient platform for both file 
            sharing, direct messaging, voice and video communication when required. It also bares the advantage 
            of being accessible both on pc and on mobile devices (through an application). What changes that 
            have been made was to confirm that notification setting are enabled and that members were actively 
            following the communication that was logged through discord. The ability to mention members and 
            it be logged as a mention through discord and have the member made aware when they access the program 
            made it easier to make members aware of directed information within the group messages.
