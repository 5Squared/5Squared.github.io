    <p>My name is Wayne, I’m 35 years old, grew up in country Queensland and moved to the Sunshine Coast / 
       Brisbane once I finished my Secondary Studies. I’ve got 2 children, a boy and a girl, aged 11 and 9 
       respectively, and a Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Lucy. When I’m not running about with my wife 
       and children, you’ll find me tending to my many chilli plants, barbequing tasty food, or relaxing with a 
       game on my computer with friends.</p>

    <p>My name is William, I was born in Sydney, Australia. I am a 29-year-old mechanic currently living on the 
        Gold Coast, Queensland with my wife and 2 children. I graduated high school in 2006, I have since completed 
        a Certificate 3 in light vehicle automatic technology, and Certificate 3 in heavy diesel technology. I have 
        recently decided to change career path and am pursuing a career in the financial services industry. I have 
        completed my diploma of financial planning and am currently undertaking accreditation courses for compliance 
        in providing advice on tier 2 financial products which I hope will get me into the industry and help make my 
        current study of ‘Bachelor of business – financial planning’ a little more relatable. My Hobby that I 
        absolutely love is online car simulator racing. I play on a title called ‘iRacing’ where I get the chance 
        to race online against other people worldwide at any time of day. I have the full setup including a direct 
        drive servo motor that I have mounted a Sparco steering wheel to. The wheel has a fully functional LCD 
        telemetry screen, carbon fibre paddle shifters and 17 functional buttons. I use an Oculus Rift virtual reality
        headset whilst racing and the immersion is just incredible.</p>

        second lowest grade for Adelaide Uni.</p>

    <p>My name is Christopher Crawford and I am currently working in a Level 2 support role. I was originally born in Durban 
        South Africa and left when I was about 12 years old. My father is South African born and my mother was born in Northern 
        England. Culturally I am a bit of mixed bag as I have lived in different places over the world. I have lived in South 
        Africa, Australia, Denmark and Wales each place I have resided for at least 3 years.
            I have studied both History and Sociology some years ago, here in Australia and Denmark. I speak Danish as a 2nd 
            language and still struggling with English. Something interesting is that I enjoy tabletop gaming and just fantasy 
            in general. I currently have 2 majors for the degree I am doing which are IT and History..</p>
