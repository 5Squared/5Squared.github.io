		<p>The jobs that the members of 5-squared ideally will have in the future are broad. 
			Their ideal roles within information technology vary between technical support, 
			security, development and end user. 
		</p>
		<p>Wayne, the teams appointed captain is looking to become a ‘Jack of all trades’ as a 
			full stack developer, he will have to develop an array of experience using a multitude 
			of different languages that are used in order to create a ‘project’. These skills will
			 make him a valuable member of any team and he will often find himself taking lead 
			 roles as he will have the knowledge to communicate with members of stack development 
			 teams whilst also relaying information to the client and vice versa.
		</p>
		<p>Chris is already in pursuit of his ideal career. As a level 2 support / change systems 
			administrator he is looking to head to that next level and fully utilise his technical 
			knowledge. As a Network and systems administrator, Chris will essentially be the go-to guy 
			for the smooth operation of a company’s information technology system. He will be the 
			trouble-shooter, the implementer and the guy who maintains the systems.  Chris’s ideal 
			role will see him relying on technical competence and a desire to further his knowledge 
			so that he can keep on top of how to make his systems more efficient and know what needs 
			to be done to keep it functioning. 
		</p>
		<p>Mathew is looking to get into a career as a cyber security engineer. Mathew will be tasked 
			with analysing and maintaining a secure environment within a network. The job will require 
			an understanding of cyber security, how to analyse and troubleshoot possible weaknesses in 
			a system and how to modify/repair a system to reduce or eliminate a security risk. There 
			will be a need to be aware of hacking trends and methods and keep abreast of any emerging 
			techniques and adjust the system to counter such threat. Mathew will have an important role 
			and will have to work closely with the users of the network and other system administrators 
			to make sure that the work they are doing will promote the security of the network. 
		</p>
		<p>Will is looking to enter a career in financial planning, essentially an adviser. Will’s ideal 
			role will be heavily focused on developing trust and repour with clients. His role is not I.t 
			related directly but the efficient utilisation of Information technology will greatly aid him 
			in servicing his clients needs and making sure he has reliable information and will be able to 
			treat sensitive client information with the attention and security it needs by utilising the 
			skills listed above that his fellow teammates will develop throughout their study and future 
			career progression.   
		</p>
		<p>The 5 Squared group has different ambitions and areas of interest within the information 
			technology world. All the roles require a degree of sound technical knowledge. Chris and 
			Matt are to be the over watchers making sure they know what their systems need to provide 
			the end user a trouble-free and secure experience. Wayne’s role differs with the need to 
			have a deep understanding of the languages of multiple stacks to make sure he can oversee 
			the development of applications and liaise with his teams. When looking at the differences 
			between the roles, it is noted that Matt and Chris are looking at roles that are aimed at 
			working with technology, using their knowledge to ensure it is operating optimally and creating 
			a great experience for the end user. Wayne’s role is a little more team leader orientated 
			and seeks to be more of a creative role where he will put a great deal of insight into helping 
			his team with the development of projects and creation of software and websites.
